
;  This patches out a jump around two calls to a function that allocates
;  all EMS pages and frees them.  The function is called twice prior to
;  allocating  VCPI pages, when a VCPI server is present.  This is
;  necessary to safeguard against a problem with allocating VCPI pages
;  from EMM386.exe from Windows 3.1.
