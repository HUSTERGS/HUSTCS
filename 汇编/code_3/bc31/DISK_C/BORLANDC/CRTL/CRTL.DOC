  1. INSTALLING LIBRARY SOURCES
  _____________________________

  The following diagram shows the recommended directory structure
  for the libraries on a hard disk. This is also the directory
  structure created by the hard disk installation program, INSTALL.
  All of the batch files that build the RTL files assume this
  directory structure.

  In the diagram, and in the text that follows, we assume that you
  have installed the RTL directory structure in a subdirectory
  named \CRTL. If you have put the RTL directory structure in a
  subdirectory other than \CRTL, simply substitute the path to that
  directory wherever \CRTL appears.

  RECOMMENDED LIBRARY DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
  _______________________________________

  \CRTL                    library root directory; all batch files
                           are contained here (BATCH.ZIP)
  \CRTL\LOG                compiler and assembler error message
                           logs
  \CRTL\LIB                library files are created here
  \CRTL\RTLINC             library header files (RTLINC.ZIP)
  \CRTL\CLIB               general library sources (CLIB1.ZIP,
                           CLIB2.ZIP).
  \CRTL\IOSTREAM           C++ stream I/O library sources
                           (IOSTREAM.ZIP)
  \CRTL\MATH               math library sources (MATH.ZIP)
  \CRTL\EMU                floating point initialization.
                           (FPINIT.ASM in MATH.ZIP)
  \CRTL\WINLIB             Windows library sources (WINLIB.ZIP)
  \CRTL\WINLIB\NOTIMP      Stubs for library functions not
                           implemented under Windows.

  To install the library source files on your hard disk, insert the
  library source distribution disk 1 in your floppy drive, and
  enter the following command at the DOS prompt:

       A:INSTALL

  The INSTALL program will default to the library directories as
  shown above and extract the source and header/include files,
  placing them in the appropriate directories. It will also extract
  several batch files that may be used to recompile and/or rebuild
  the C and MATH libraries. It is a good idea to have a look at
  these batch files, to see how the source modules are compiled and
  how the libraries are built.

  The following batch files will be placed in \CRTL:

  BUILD.BAT      Compiles and assembles ALL modules in one or more
                 libraries, for one or more memory models.

  ALL.BAT        Compiles and assembles ALL modules in ALL
                 libraries, for ALL memory models.

  These batch files assume the recommended directory structure. For
  usage information and an example, see section 5 or enter the name
  of the batch file without any parameters.

  If you choose to compile or assemble a module without using the
  batch files, be aware that certain files need special switches.
  Make sure to check the configuration files (TASM.CFG and
  TURBOC.CFG) and the batch files to find the necessary switches.


  2. RUNTIME LIBRARY OVERVIEW
  ___________________________

  Most of the library routines require .H files from Borland C++,
  and you'll also need TLIB, the object file librarian.

  The runtime libraries are blocks of object code grouped together
  in several library files.  These library files contain the
  general library routines and the standard math routines.

  FPINIT.ASM is provided to allow you to modify the floating-point
  initialization and termination process.  If you used the
  installation batch file, this file will be found in a
  subdirectory called EMU. FPINIT.ASM is used to create two OBJ
  files, one for the emulator (FPINIT.OBJ) and one for inline 8087
  instructions (FP87INIT.OBJ). The following command lines will
  create these two files from the EMU subdirectory.

       TASM /MX /t /z fpinit
       TASM /MX /t /z /DFP87 fpinit, fp87init

  Most of the modules contained in the runtime libraries are object
  files produced by compiling the library source files with the
  Borland C++ compiler.  Some of the files contain inline assembly
  language code; therefore you will need a TASM 2.0 (or compatible)
  Macro Assembler to compile those source files. Finally, a few
  modules are written entirely in assembly language.

  Here is a key to some of the file extensions found in the RTL:

  .C             C source file
  .CPP           C++ source file
  .H             C header file
  .CAS           C source file with inline assembler
  .ASM           Assembler source file
  .ASI           Include file needed for .ASM files
  .CFG           Configuration files for Borland C++ and Turbo
                 Assembler.
  .ZIP           Archive file

  The library source files have been grouped together into several
  "archive" files (.ZIP extensions). An archive file contains a
  collection of files in a compressed form. You use the UNZIP
  utility to extract files from the archive. Here is the usage
  information for UNZIP:

  Usage: UNZIP [options] zipfile [destpath] [files...]

  Options:
  /o = overwrite existing files         /v = verbose listing of archive(s)
  /c = extract file(s) to the console   /p = extract file(s) to the printer
  /t = test archive integrity

  zipfile    Archive file name, wildcards *,? ok.  Default extension is .ZIP
  destpath   Destination for extracted files.
  files      Name(s) of files to extract.  Wildcards *,? ok.
             Default is ALL files.

  Examples:
    UNZIP CLIB1                     - Unpack all files in CLIB1 to
                                       current drive and directory.
    UNZIP MATH C:\CRTL\MATH        - Unpack all files in MATH.ZIP to
                                       C:\LIBRARY\MATH directory.
    UNZIP CLIB2 C: *.CPP *.CAS      - Unpack all .CPP and .CAS files in
                                       CLIB2.ZIP to drive C.


  3. MODIFYING LIBRARY FILES
  __________________________

  This section describes how to modify a source module, compile or
  assemble it, and replace it in a library. If you have installed
  the source using INSTALL, there are several batch files included
  to make your job easier; see section 5 for more information.

  You can modify a library file by first changing the corresponding
  source file, compiling (or assembling) the modified source file
  into an object file, and finally rebuilding the library files
  from its constituent object files.

  In order to compile most of the library source files, the
  standard header files and the library header files (contained in
  RTLINC.ZIP) #included in most of the C source files must be
  present on your system. They must be made available to Borland
  C++ through the -I option.

  The following steps are recommended for modifying a library
  module. You might want to modify all the modules you need, then
  rebuild the library (or libraries) from scratch.

     1.  Install all the source files on a hard disk using the
         installation procedure described in section 1.  Even
         though you will not be modifying all of the source files,
         the makefiles that build the libraries assume that all
         source files are present.

     2.  Figure out which module you need to modify, and to which
         library file(s) it belongs.

         The library listing feature of TLIB will be helpful here,
         since it shows all the modules in a library file, together
         with all the functions that the modules define. Use "tlib
         lib-name,con" or "tlib lib-name,listfile-name."

         Note that the general routine libraries (CS.LIB, CC.LIB,
         CM.LIB, CL.LIB, and CH.LIB) all contain the same set of
         modules, compiled for different memory models; likewise
         for the math routine libraries (MATHS.LIB, MATHC.LIB,
         MATHM.LIB, MATHL.LIB, and MATHH.LIB), and the Windows
         libraries (CWS.LIB, CWC.LIB, CWM.LIB, CWL.LIB, and
         CWH.LIB).

     3.  Apply and test all the changes you need to make.

         To test a C library module, write a simple testing
         program, and compile and link both modules at the same
         time; for example:

              BCC  [options]  tsrchp  searchp.cas

         That way you make sure the tested module will not be
         linked in from the library.

         For an assembler file, assemble the library file, then
         link it with a test file using BCC; for example:

              TASM lrsh /MX;

              BCC  [options]  tstshf  lrsh.obj

     4.  Recompile the module and replace it in the library
         file(s).

         The batch file BUILD.BAT is provided on the distribution
         disk to help with rebuilding the libraries. It compiles or
         assembles all modules that are more recent than the
         corresponding object files, or which do not have object
         files, then rebuilds the library from its object files.

         For batch file usage information and examples, see section
         5 or enter the name of the batch file without any
         parameters.

         If you are using a floppy-based system, don't use these
         batch files. At this point, it's easier just to update the
         library with the .OBJ file. Remember, TLIB creates a
         backup of the library file, so make sure you have plenty
         of space.

  4. LICENSE AGREEMENT
  ____________________

  Borland C++ Runtime Library Source Code
  Borland's No-Nonsense License Agreement

  Borland International, Inc. (Borland) is offering you a license
  to the source code to the Borland C++ Runtime Library portion of
  Borland C++ (the Source Programs), including updates that may
  later be supplied by Borland at additional cost, but not
  including the source code of the 8087 emulator or the graphics
  library.

  The Source Programs are protected by both United States copyright
  law and international treaty provisions. Therefore, you must
  treat the Source Programs just like a book, with the following
  single exception:  Borland authorizes you to make archival copies
  of the Source Programs for the sole purpose of backing-up your
  programs and protecting your investments from loss.

  By "just like a book," Borland means, for example, that the
  Source Programs may be used by any number of people and may be
  freely moved from one computer workstation to another, so long as
  there is no possibility of them being used at one computer
  workstation at the same time they are being used at another. Just
  as a book can't be read by two different people in two different
  places at the same time, neither can the Source Programs be used
  by two different people in two different places at the same time.
  (Unless, of course, Borland's copyright has been violated.)

  You may modify the Source Programs, but the modified source code,
  regardless of the extent of the modifications, shall always
  remain Borland's source code. You may not remove or modify
  Borland's copyright and other proprietary copyright notices, and
  you may not transport any of the Source Programs to another
  computer operating system or environment. You are responsible for
  all claims, liability, and damages arising from your own
  modifications and the products which include them.

  You may use the Source Programs to support your licensed copies
  of Borland C++. This means you may include all or some of the
  original or modified Source Programs routines in your own Borland
  C++ based programs, but you may only distribute binary copies of
  such routines when linked into your executable programs. You may
  not distribute any source code for the original or modified
  Borland C++ Runtime Library under any circumstances. You are not,
  of course, restricted from distributing your own source code.

  5. MORE INFORMATION ON THE BATCH FILES
  ______________________________________

  The following descriptions are of the batch files you may find
  useful when modifying the library source files.  All of them
  assume that you have installed the sources by using INSTALL.
  Usage information can also be found by entering the name of the
  batch file without any parameters.

  There are two batch files that you can use to build libraries:
  ALL.BAT and BUILD.BAT. The batch files work by invoking MAKE with
  a master MAKEFILE, \CRTL\MAKEFILE. This makefile, in turn,
  invokes MAKE with makefiles for specific libraries. These
  library-specific makefiles have the extension .MAK.  For example,
  one of the the makefiles that is used to build the Windows
  libraries is \CRTL\WINLIB\WINLIB.MAK.

  Note that the makefiles invoke TLIB with the /0 option when
  replacing modules in the CLIB and WINLIB libraries, and with the
  /0 /E options when replacing modules in the MATH libraries. If
  you want to build one or more library files to include debugging
  information (so that you can step through library calls with TC
  or TD), you have to remove both the /E and /0 options from the
  TLIB command line(s), as these options effectively remove all
  debugging information from library files.

  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
  _____________________

  The batch files use two environment variables to determine which
  memory models should be used, and where the error log should be
  saved.

  The environment variable MODEL specifies which memory models
  should be used.  Set it to all the memory model letters you want
  to use. Separate the letters with spaces, and be sure to use only
  lower-case letters. For example, if you want to compile for all
  memory models, use all the model letters:

       set MODEL=s c m l h

  If you want to compile for just one memory model, set MODEL to a
  single letter: use the command:

       set MODEL=s

  If you don't set MODEL, the batch files will use all memory
  models.

  The environment variable LOGFILE determines where the compiler
  and assembler error messages will be saved.  If you want the
  error messages to be displayed on the screen, use the following
  command before you run the batch files:

       set LOGFILE=CON

  If you don't set LOGFILE, the batch files will set it to the
  default value ..\LOG\CRTL.LOG. The directory ..\LOG is a
  subdirectory of \CRTL, and if doesn't already exist, you must
  create it with the command:

       MKDIR \CRTL\LOG

  The batch files also use environment variables to control the
  operation of the compiler, assembler, and librarian. These
  variables are set in VARS.BAT.  You can edit this file to change
  the operation of the tools. For example, if you want to compile
  with debugging information turned on, add -v to the line in
  VARS.BAT that defines the TC environment variable, and remove /0
  from the line that defines the TLIB environment variable.

  You should always run VARS.BAT before running BUILD.BAT.

  BUILD.BAT
  _________

  This batch file will recompile all modified modules (or modules
  which have no corresponding object files) for a specific library
  (or all libraries) for one or more memory models. It places the
  resultant object files in the appropriate subdirectory (for
  example, the S subdirectory for small model). It then rebuilds
  the library from its object files.

  The "libtype" parameter specified which library should be built:
  CLIB, WINLIB, WINDLL, STARTUP, or MATH.  If you want to build all
  libraries, specify ALL.

  The environment variable MODEL specifies which memory models are
  to be used. If MODEL is not set, BUILD.BAT uses all memory
  models.

  The current directory must be \CRTL when you run BUILD.BAT.

  Usage:

       build libtype

  Examples:

       build all
       build math
       build clib

  Note that recompiling all the source files using this batch file
  may take a considerable amount of time.  But once the files have
  been compiled, subsequent runs of BUILD.BAT will compile only
  those modules that have changed.


  ALL.BAT
  _______

  This batch file builds all libraries in all memory model by
  repeatedly invoking BUILD.BAT.  Not only will this will take a
  considerable amount of time, but will also consume large amounts
  of disk space.
