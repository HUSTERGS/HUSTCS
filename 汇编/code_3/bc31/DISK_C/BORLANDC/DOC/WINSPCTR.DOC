Introduction
===========================================================================

                    WinSpector and its utilities help you perform a
                    postmortem examination of Windows Unrecoverable
                    Application Errors (UAEs).

                    How to use it:

                    1. Run WinSpector.

                    2. When a UAE (exception) occurs, WinSpector writes a
                       log file to your disk.

                    3. A Windows "Unrecoverable Application Error" box is
                       displayed.

                    4. Choose OK.

                    5. A WinSpector dialog box with a brief exception
                       report is displayed.

                    6. Choose OK.

                    7. Read the log file. It contains information that can
                       help you find the cause of the exception.

                    What it can show you:

                    o the call stack

                    o function and procedures names in the call stack (with
                      a little help from you)

                    o CPU registers

                    o a disassembly of the instructions

                    o Windows information

Configuring WinSpector
===========================================================================

                    WinSpector can be configured to suit your needs. Four
                    options allow you to gather specific information. See
                    the section "Setting preferences" for information on
                    these options.

                    o Set System Information
                    o Stack Frame Data
                    o User Comments
                    o PostMortem Dump

                    Three preprocessing utilities help you make .SYM files
                    available prior to exception. WinSpector uses the .SYM
                    files to greatly enhance the exception report. See the
                    section "Other WinSpector tools" for information on
                    these utilities.

                    o BUILDSYM
                    o TMAPSYM
                    o EXEMAP

                    DFA, WinSpector's post-processing utility, can use
                    Turbo Debugger symbolic information to further
                    enhancing readability of available UAE information.


           Setting  =======================================================
       preferences
                    WinSpector's options can be set either in the
                    Preferences dialog box or by entering commands directly
                    into the WINSPCTR.INI file. Both methods are discussed
                    here.


------------------  The Directory option in the Preferences dialog box lets
   Setting the log  you decide where the log file is written. If you do not
    file directory  specify a directory, it defaults to the Windows
------------------  directory.

                    >> Specifying a directory -----------------------------

                    1. Open the Preferences dialog box.

                    2. Enter the directory name in the Directory input box.

                    3. Choose OK.

                    or

                    o Add LogDir=[directory] to the WINSPCTR.INI file.


------------------  The Viewer option in the Preferences dialog box is
   Setting the log  where you specify what program to use for viewing the
       file viewer  log file. If you do not specify a directory, it
------------------  defaults to the Windows Notepad.

                    If an exception has occurred during the current Windows
                    session, choose View Log on the Latest UAE dialog box
                    or the Preferences dialog box to see the log file. View
                    Log runs the selected viewing program and passes the
                    WINSPCTR.LOG file as a command line argument.

                    To view a previous log file, choose View Log file from
                    the WinSpector system menu.

                    >> Specifying a viewer --------------------------------

                    1. Open the Preferences Dialog Box.



                                   - 3 -






                    2. Enter the viewer in the Viewer text box.

                    3. Choose OK.

                    or

                    o Add LogViewer=[viewer name] to the WINSPCTR.INI file.


------------------  The Append New Reports and Overwrite Previous Reports
    Overwriting or  options in the Preferences dialog box let you either
  appending to the  append reports to the previous log file or overwrite
          log file  the previous log file when a new report is generated.
------------------  The default setting is to overwrite the previous log
                    file.

                    If you choose to overwrite the previous log file, the
                    first time an exception occurs the previous log file is
                    overwritten. Subsequent exceptions that occur during
                    the same Windows session will be appended.

                    >> Appending reports to the previous log file ---------

                    1. Open the Preferences Dialog Box.

                    2. Set Log File to Append New Reports.

                    3. Choose OK.

                    or

                    o Add CreateNewLog=0 to the WINSPCTR.INI file.

                    >> Overwriting the previous log file ------------------

                    1. Open the Preferences Dialog Box.

                    2. Set Log File to Overwrite Previous Reports.

                    3. Choose OK.

                    or

                    o Add CreateNewLog=1 to the WINSPCTR.INI file.

------------------  The System Information option in the Preferences dialog
    Writing system  box lets you add the Task List, the Module List, and
information to the  information about the USER and GDI heaps to the log
          log file  file. The default is to include system information in
------------------  the report.

                    >> Including system information in the log file -------

                    1. Open the Preferences Dialog Box.

                    2. Under Report Information, check System Info.

                    3. Choose OK.

                    or

                    o Add ShowSystemInfo=1 to the WINSPCTR.INI file.

                    >> Omitting system information from the log file ------

                    1. Open the Preferences Dialog Box.

                    2. Under Report Information, uncheck System Info.

                    3. Choose OK.

                    or

                    o Add ShowSystemInfo=0 to the WINSPCTR.INI file.


------------------  The AUX Summary option in the Preferences dialog box
        Sending an  tells WinSpector to write an abbreviated form of the
 exception summary  report to the AUX device, in addition to writing the
  to the debugging  complete log file. To use this option, you need a
          terminal  terminal connected to AUX or a device driver that
------------------  redirects AUX to a second monitor. The default is no
                    output to AUX.

                    >> Sending a summary to AUX ---------------------------

                    1. Open the Preferences Dialog Box.

                    2. Under Report Information, check Summary To AUX.

                    3. Choose OK.





                                   - 5 -






                    or

                    o Add LogToStdAux=1 to the WINSPCTR.INI file.

                    >> Not sending a summary to AUX -----------------------

                    1. Open the Preferences Dialog Box.

                    2. Under Report Information, uncheck Summary To AUX.

                    3. Choose OK.

                    or

                    o Add LogToStdAux=0 to the WINSPCTR.INI file.


------------------  The Stack Frame Data option in the Preferences dialog
     Writing stack  box lets you add a verbose stack trace display to the
 frame data to the  log file. For each stack frame that doesn't exceed 256
          log file  bytes, a hex dump is performed, starting at the SS:BP
------------------  for that frame. If there are more than 256 bytes
                    between 2 successive stack frames, the memory display
                    is omitted for that frame. This data can be used to get
                    the values of parameters that were passed to the
                    function. The default is to not generate a verbose
                    stack trace.


                    It is usually easier to let the DFA utility do the hard
                    work of figuring out what your parameters are. However,
                    for those cases where you do not have Turbo Debugger
                    information available, a verbose trace may be helpful.

                    >> Adding stack frame data to the log file ------------

                    1. Open the Preferences Dialog Box.

                    2. Under Report Information, check Stack Frame Data.

                    3. Choose OK.

                    or

                    o Add ShowStackInfo=1 to the WINSPCTR.INI file.

                    raw binary data into a useful form. It generates a file
                    that contains stack trace similar to the one in the log
                    file, but with function names and line numbers, as well

Using WinSpector when an exception occurs
===========================================================================

                    When you get a UAE (in Windows 3.0) or a fault (in
                    Windows 3.1), WinSpector goes to work, writing the
                    information you've requested to files. The log file
                    WINSPCTR.LOG is a text file you can read but
                    WINSPCTR.BIN is a binary file that the DFA utility
                    analyzes.

      WINSPCTR.BIN  =======================================================

                    See the section "Other WinSpector tools" for details
                    about WINSPCTR.BIN.


      WINSPCTR.LOG  =======================================================

                    The first line of the report(s) in WINSPCTR.LOG gives
                    the date and time when the exception occurred. The
                    second line lists

                    o what type of exception occurred
                    o the module name
                    o the logical address
                    o the physical address
                    o the current task at time of exception.

                    If the stack pointer is too small at time of exception,
                    TOOLHELP.DLL automatically switches the stack. When
                    this happens, the message "Stack Switched" is appended
                    to the end of the second line of the log.


------------------  The first line of the disassembly section in the log
       Disassembly  file identifies the assembly language instruction that
           section  caused the exception.
------------------
                    This is followed by the next few instructions in the
                    program. These subsequent commands are listed to
                    provide a point of reference for finding the task that
                    caused the exception.


------------------  The first line of the stack trace section of the log
       Stack trace  identifies the function or procedure that was executing
           section  at the time of the exception. Stack Trace information
------------------  includes:

                    o frame number

                    o module name

                    o the name of the closest function before the address
                      of the one that caused the exception, plus a number
                      indicating how far away you were from that function

                      (this information is present only if a .SYM file is
                      present)

                    o logical and physical address for the stack frame

                    o where your program comes back to after the call.

                    When WinSpector gives function names, it looks in the
                    .SYM file for the closest symbol name that appears
                    before the address in the call stack. Some .SYM files
                    do not contain information for all functions. Thus, the
                    function name appearing in the log file will be that of
                    the closest function in the .SYM file with an address
                    preceding the frame address. If the offset field
                    appears to be too high, function names are suspect.


------------------  The register section of the log file gives the values
  Register section  that are in the standard registers at the time of
------------------  exception. Limits and access rights are given for the
                    CS, DS, ES, and SS registers.


------------------  The message queue section of the log file gives the
     Message queue  last message actually received in the middle of
           section  processing. Also given is a list of any messages that
------------------  were waiting in the queue at the time of exception.
                    Listed is the following information.

                    o window handle (identifies what window)
                    o message ID number (identifies what it was)
                    o two parameters (present for any given window)

                    What is recorded in the message queue section may not
                    really be the last message the program received.
                    Windows may bypass the message queue (using the
                    SendMessage function, for example). Keep that in mind
                    when using message queue information.


------------------  The tasks section of the log file lists all programs
     Tasks section  running in the system at the time of exception. Given
------------------  is:

                    o complete path for executor file
                    o module name
                    o windows module handle
                    o task handle

                    o what the data segment value was for the task (the
                      instance handle)


------------------  The Modules section of the log lists the modules that
   Modules section  were running at time of exception. Given is:
------------------
                    o path for executor file
                    o the date
                    o the file size
                    o module name
                    o module handle
                    o reference count (how many times the module is in
                      use).


------------------  The USER and GDI heap information section of the log
 USER and GDI heap  shows what percentage of the USER and GDI heaps was
       information  available at the time of exception.
------------------

------------------  The System Information section of the log file shows
System information  the mode and
           section  windows version under which your program was run. Also
------------------  given is:

                    o CPU information
                    o largest free memory block
                    o total linear memory space
                    o free linear memory space
                    o swap file pages

Processing WinSpector data
===========================================================================

                    The DFA utility post processes Turbo Debugger
                    information gathered by WinSpector at the time of
                    exception. WinSpector writes a WINSPCTR.BIN file at the
                    time of exception if report information is set to
                    PostMortem Dump. DFA can then be used to translate the
                    WINSPCTR.BIN file into a useful format.

        DFA output  =======================================================

                    The DFA utility writes a file only if Turbo Debugger
                    information exists for the file in the stack frame. The
                    DFA output file (DFA.OUT) has a stack trace similar to
                    the one in the WinSpector log file, except that it has:

                    o function names
                    o line numbers
                    o local and global variables
                    o data segments and their values (including the stack
                      segment).

                    Only one WINSPCTR.BIN file is written per Windows
                    session, so post-process files promptly. You may then
                    want to rename or delete the DFA.OUT and WINSPCTR.LOG
                    files, to allow for more than one exception in a
                    session.

    Using DFA with  =======================================================
      WINSPCTR.LOG
                    When used with the WINSPCTR.LOG file alone, DFA gives
                    minimal stack trace information such as addresses.
                    Source filenames and line numbers are added to the
                    report when Turbo Debugger information (a .TDS file) is
                    present either in the executable file or in a separate
                    file.


    Using DFA with  =======================================================
      WINSPCTR.BIN
                    When used with the WINSPCTR.BIN file, DFA makes
                    additional information available:

                    o Stack based variables are added to the log, including
                      structures and arrays.

                    o Variable types, values, and addresses are listed by
                      function.


                    If a Turbo Debugger .TDS file is present, for each
                    stack frame, DFA reports:

                    o Section one

                      - source file

                      - line number
                      - local variables
                      - parameters.

                    o Section two

                      - module name for the task with the fault
                      - filenames
                      - logical segments
                      - their selectors
                      - whether it's data or code.

                    o Section three

                      - global variables
                      - static variables
                      - their values at time of exception.

            Syntax  =======================================================

                    DFA [option] WINSPCTR.LOG [WINSPCTR.BIN]

                    The WINSPCTR.LOG file is required. With it, you get
                    source file and line numbers. With WINSPCTR.BIN
                    (optional), you get variable information.

                        /O[outputfile]
                        Renames the output file from the DFA.OUT default

                        /D
                        Forces DFA to write out a hex dump of the saved
                    data segments

                    EXEMAP, TMAPSYM, and BUILDSYM are three utilities that

                    an exception.

   Creating a .MAP  =======================================================
      file from an
        executable  EXEMAP creates .MAP files for Windows executables. A
                    .MAP file can be used to create a .SYM file, which can
                    then be used by WinSpector to enhance the error
                    reporting. This can be especially useful for use with
                    .DLLs or other programs that you don't have source code
                    for.

                    Although the resulting .MAP file isn't as complete as
                    one generated by the linker, it does include addresses
                    for exported public functions.


------------------  EXEMAP exefilename [output mapfile]
            Syntax
------------------  If [output mapfile] is not given, it defaults to
                    exefilename.MAP.


   Creating a .SYM  =======================================================
  file from a .MAP
              file  TMAPSYM creates .SYM files from existing .MAP files
                    (created either by TLINK or by the EXEMAP utility). The
                    resulting .SYM files make public functions, variable
                    names, and functions in the entry table of the
                    executable available to WinSpector. Constants and line
                    number information is not included in a TMAPSYM
                    generated .SYM file.

------------------  TMAPSYM filename[.MAP]
            Syntax
------------------  The .MAP extension is optional.


------------------  Borland C++ precompiled header files use a .SYM
             Notes  extension and could be inadvertently overwritten when
------------------  generating a .SYM (symbol) file. If you are using the
                    command line compiler, there is an option to rename the
                    header file so that there is no naming conflict.

                    BUILDSYM overwrites any existing .SYM file. To be safe,
                    copy
                    existing .SYM files before using BUILDSYM or TMAPSYM.

     Creating .SYM  =======================================================
        files from
       executables  The BUILDSYM utility offers a convenient way to create
                    .SYM files for one or more executable programs in a
                    directory.

                    When .SYM files are not available, creating them
                    without BUILDSYM is a two step process:

                    1. Use the EXEMAP utility on the program to make a .MAP
                       file

                    2. Use the TMAPSYM utility on the .MAP file to make a
                       .SYM file

                    BUILDSYM uses EXEMAP and TMAPSYM, but you enter only
                    one command to complete the process. BUILDSYM also
                    erases .MAP files from your directory after .SYM files
                    are created. BUILDSYM's support for wild cards in the
                    syntax lets you create .SYM files for part or all of a
                    directory by entering a single command.

                    BUILDSYM requires that EXEMAP and TMAPSYM utilities be
                    in your search path. Resulting .SYM files are placed in
                    the current directory. For WinSpector to find a .SYM
                    file, it must be in the same directory as the
                    executable where the exception occurred.

                    BUILDSYM:

                    o verifies that the files are really Windows files (if
                      they're not, BUILDSYM leaves them alone)

                    o calls EXEMAP to create .MAP files

                    o verifies that .MAP files were created

                    o calls TMAPSYM, passing the names of the new .MAP
                      files, to create .SYM files

                    o deletes the .MAP files (which are no longer needed)
