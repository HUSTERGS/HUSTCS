HOW TO USE THIS FILE
===========================================================================

                    This file has a table of contents and an index that
                    refer to "pages" in this file. If your editor has a
                    search facility, you can use it to search for the page
                    numbers listed in either the table of contents or in
                    the index. The phrase "Page n" (where n represents the
                    actual page number) appears at the bottom left of the
                    "page" it refers to. Thus, at the bottom of page 1,
                    you'll find "Page 1" as the last item on that "page."

                    This file explains what each utility is and
                    illustrates, with code and command-line examples, how
                    to use them.



===========================================================================
BGIOBJ: Converting graphics drivers and fonts
===========================================================================

                    You can use BGIOBJ to convert graphics driver files and
                    character sets (stroked font files) to object (.OBJ)
                    files. Once they're converted, you can link them into
                    your program, making them part of the executable file.
                    This is in addition to the graphics package's dynamic
                    loading scheme, in which your program loads graphics
                    drivers and character sets (stroked fonts) from disk at
                    run time.

                    Linking drivers and fonts directly into your program is
                    advantageous because the executable file contains all
                    (or most) of the drivers and/or fonts it might need,
                    and doesn't need to access the driver and font files on
                    disk when running. However, linking the drivers and
                    fonts into your executable file increases its size.

                    To convert a driver or font file to a linkable object
                    file, use the BGIOBJ.EXE utility. This is the
                    simplified syntax:

                      BGIOBJ source_file

                    where source_file is the driver or font file to be
                    converted to an object file. The object file created
                    has the same file name as the source file, with the




                                   - 2 -






                    extension .OBJ; for example, EGAVGA.BGI yields
                    EGAVGA.OBJ, SANS.CHR gives SANS.OBJ, and so on.


    Adding the new  =======================================================
     .OBJ files to
      GRAPHICS.LIB  You should add the driver and font object modules to
                    GRAPHICS.LIB, so the linker can locate them when it
                    links in the graphics routines. If you don't add these
                    new object modules to GRAPHICS.LIB, you'll have to add
                    them to the list of files in the project (.PRJ) file,
                    on the BCC command line, or on the TLINK command line.
                    To add these object modules to GRAPHICS.LIB, invoke
                    TLIB with the following command line:

                      tlib graphics + object_file_name [+ object_file_name
                    ...]

                    where object_file_name is the name of the object file
                    created by BGIOBJ.EXE (such as CGA, EGAVGA, GOTH, and
                    so forth). The .OBJ extension is implied, so you don't
                    need to include it. You can add several files with one
                    command line to save time; see the example in the
                    following section.


   Registering the  =======================================================
 drivers and fonts
                    After adding driver and font object modules to
                    GRAPHICS.LIB, you have to register all the drivers and
                    fonts that you want linked in; you do this by calling
                    registerbgidriver and registerbgifont in your program
                    (before calling initgraph). This informs the graphics
                    system of the presence of those files, and ensures that
                    they will be linked in when the executable file is
                    created by the linker.

                    The registering routines each take one parameter; a
                    symbolic name defined in graphics.h. Each registering
                    routine returns a nonnegative value if the driver or
                    font is successfully registered.

                    The following table shows the names to be used with
                    registerbgidriver and registerbgifont. It is a complete
                    list of drivers and fonts included with Borland C++.

 IBM8514         IBM8514_driver

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------  Suppose you want to convert the files for the CGA
        An example  graphics driver, the gothic font, and the triplex font
------------------  to object modules, then link them into your program.
                    Here's what you do:

                    1. Convert the binary files to object files using
                       BGIOBJ.EXE, as shown in the following separate com-
                       mand lines:

                        bgiobj  cga
                        bgiobj  trip
                        bgiobj  goth

                       This creates three files: CGA.OBJ, TRIP.OBJ, and
                       GOTH.OBJ.

                    2. You can add these object files to GRAPHICS.LIB with
                       this TLIB command line:

                          tlib  graphics  +cga  +trip  +goth

                    3. If you don't add the object files to GRAPHICS.LIB,
                       you must add the object file names CGA.OBJ,
                       TRIP.OBJ, and GOTH.OBJ to your project list (if you
                       are using Borland C++'s integrated environment), or
                       to the BCC command line. For example, the BCC com-
                       mand line would look like this:

                          BCc  niftgraf graphics.lib  cga.obj  trip.obj
                       goth.obj

                    4. You register these files in your graphics program
                       like this:

 If you ever get a      /* Header file declares CGA_driver, triplex_font &
      linker error      gothic_font */
   Segment exceeds      #include <graphics.h>
 64K after linking
   in some drivers      /* Register and check for errors (one never
     and/or fonts,      knows...) */
      refer to the
following section.      if (registerbgidriver(CGA_driver) < 0) exit(1);
                        if (registerbgifont(triplex_font) < 0) exit(1);
                        if (registerbgifont(gothic_font)  < 0) exit(1);

                        /* ... */



                                   - 4 -






                        initgraph(....);     /* initgraph should be called
                                                after registering */

                        /* ... */


     The /F option  =======================================================

                    This section explains what steps to take if you get the
                    linker error Segment exceeds 64K (or a similar error)
                    after linking in several driver and/or font files
                    (especially with small- and compact-model programs).

                    By default, the files created by BGIOBJ.EXE all use the
                    same segment (called _TEXT). This can cause problems if
                    your program links in many drivers and/or fonts, or
                    when you're using the small or compact memory model.

                    To solve this problem, you can convert one or more of
                    the drivers or fonts with the BGIOBJ /F option. This
                    option directs BGIOBJ to use a segment name of the form
                    filename_TEXT, so that the default segment is not
                    overburdened by all the linked-in drivers and fonts
                    (and, in small and compact model programs, all the pro-
                    gram code). For example, the following two BGIOBJ com-
                    mand lines direct BGIOBJ to use segment names of the

                     bgiobj  /F  sans

                    When you select /F, BGIOBJ also appends F to the target
                    object file name (EGAVGAF.OBJ, SANSF.OBJ, and so
                    forth), and appends _far to the name that will be used
                    with registerfarbgidriver and registerfarbgifont. (For
                    example, EGAVGA_driver becomes EGAVGA_driver_far.)

                    For files created with /F, you must use these far
                    registering routines instead of the regular
                    registerbgidriver and registerbgifont. For example,

                     if (registerfarbgidriver(EGAVGA_driver_far) < 0)
                     exit(1);
                     if (registerfarbgifont(sansserif_font_far)  < 0)
                     exit(1);


 Advanced features  =======================================================

                    features, and the routines registerfarbgidriver and
                    registerfarbgifont. Only experienced users should use

                    /F or -F               This option instructs BGIOBJ.EXE
                                           to use a segment name other than
                                           _TEXT (the default), and to
                                           change the public name and
                                           destination file name. (See page

                    source                 This is the driver or font file
                                           to be converted. If the file is
                                           not one of the driver/font files
                                           shipped with Borland C++, you
                                           should specify a full file name
                                           (including extension).

                    destination            This is the name of the object
                                           file to be produced. The default
                                           destination file name is
                                           source.OBJ, or sourceF.OBJ if
                                           you use the /F option.

                    public-name            This is the name that will be
                                           used in the program in a call to
                                           registerbgidriver or
                                           registerbgifont (or their
                                           respective far versions) to link
                                           in the object module.

                                           The public name is the external
                                           name used by the linker, so it
                                           should be the name used in the
                                           program, prefixed with an
                                           underscore. If your program uses
                                           Pascal calling conventions, use
                                           only uppercase letters, and do
                                           not add an underscore.

                    seg-name               This is an optional segment
                                           name; the default is _TEXT (or

                                           specified)

                    seg-class              This is an optional segment
                                           class; the default is CODE.

                    -------------------------------------------------------

                    All parameters except source are optional. However, if
                    you need to specify an optional parameter, all the
                    parameters preceding it must also be specified.

                    If you choose to use your own public name(s), you have
                    to add declaration(s) to your program, using one of the
                    following forms:

                     void public_name(void);        /* if /F not used, */
                                                    /* default segment name
                     used */

                     extern int far public_name[];  /* if /F used, or */
                                                    /* segment name not
                     _TEXT */

                    In these declarations, public_name matches the public-
                    name you used when converting with BGIOBJ. The
                    graphics.h header file contains declarations of the
                    default driver and font public names; if you use those
                    default public names you don't have to declare them as
                    just described.

                    After these declarations, you have to register all the
                    drivers and fonts in your program. If you don't use the
                    /F option and don't change the default segment name,
                    you should register drivers and fonts through
                    registerbgidriver and registerbgifont; otherwise, use
                    registerfarbgidriver and registerfarbgifont.

                    Here is an example of a program that loads a font file
                    into memory:

                     /* Example of loading a font file into memory */

    normal compil-
       ations of C  You use CPP just as you would use BCC, the standalone
         programs.  compiler. CPP reads the same TURBOC.CFG file for
                    default options, and accepts the same command-line
                    options as BCC.

                    The BCC options that don't pertain to CPP are simply
                    ignored by CPP. To see the list of arguments handled by
                    CPP, type cpp at the DOS prompt. To see how those
                    arguments work, see Chapter 5 in the Programmer's
                    Guide.

                    With one exception, the file names listed on the CPP
                    command line are treated like they are in BCC, with
                    wildcards allowed. The exception to this is that all
                    files are treated as C source files. There is no
                    special treatment for .OBJ, .LIB, or .ASM files.

                    For each file processed by CPP, the output is written
                    to a file in the current directory (or the output
                    directory named by the -n option) with the same name as
                    the source name but with an extension of .I.

                    This output file is a text file containing each line of
                    the source file and any include files. Any preproces-
                    sing directive lines have been removed, along with any
                    conditional text lines excluded from the compile.
                    Unless you use a command-line option to specify other-

                    wise, text lines are prefixed with the file name and
                    line number of the source or include file the line came
                    from. Within a text line, any macros are replaced with
                    their expansion text.

        Important!  The resulting output of CPP cannot be compiled because
                    of the file name and line number prefix attached to
                    each source line.


    CPP as a macro  =======================================================
      preprocessor
                    The -P option to CPP tells it to prefix each line with
                    the source file name and line number. If you give it -
                    P- (turning this option off), CPP omits this line
                    number information. With this option turned off, CPP
                    can be used as a macro preprocessor; the resulting .I
                    file can then be compiled with BC or BCC.


        An example  =======================================================

                    The following simple program illustrates how CPP
                    preprocesses a file, first with -P selected, then with
                    -P-.

GREP: A text-search utility
===========================================================================

                    GREP (Global Regular Expression Print) is a powerful
                    text-search program derived from the UNIX utility of
                    the same name. GREP searches for a text pattern in one
                    or more files or in its standard input stream.

                    Here's a quick example of a situation where you might
                    want to use GREP. Suppose you wanted to find out which
                    text files in your current directory contained the
                    string "Bob". You would issue the command

                       grep Bob *.txt

                    and GREP would respond with a list of the lines in each
                    file (if any) that contained the string "Bob". Because
                    the default for GREP is to ignore case, the strings
                    "bob" and "BoB" would also be considered matches. You
                    can use options to make your search case sensitive.

                    GREP can do a lot more than match a single, fixed
                    string. In the section that follows, you'll see how to
                    make GREP search for any string that matches a
                    particular pattern.


      Command-line  =======================================================
            syntax
                    The general command-line syntax for GREP is

                      grep [options] searchstring [file(s) ... ]

                    options consist of one or more letters, preceded by a
                    hyphen (-), that let you change various aspects of
                    GREP's behavior.

                    searchstring gives the pattern to search for.

                    file(s) tells GREP which files to search. (If you don't
                    specify a file, GREP searches its standard input; this
                    lets you use GREP with pipes and redirection.) If you
                    find that the results of your GREP are longer than one
                    screen, you can redirect the output to a file. For
                    example, you could use this command




                                  - 11 -






                       GREP "Bob" *.txt >gfile

                    which searches all files in the current directory that
                    end with .TXT, then places the results in a file called
                    GFILE. (You can name this file anything you like.)
                    Then, use your word processor (or Borland C++'s editor)
                    to access GFILE to read the results of the search.

                    The command

                       GREP ?

                    prints a brief help screen showing GREP's command-line
                    options, special characters, and defaults. (See the
                    description of the -u command-line option for
                    information on how to change GREP's defaults.)


      GREP options  =======================================================

                    In the command line, options are one or more single
                    characters preceded by a hyphen (-). Each individual
                    character is a switch that you can turn on or off: A
                    plus symbol (+) after a character turns the option on;
                    a hyphen (-) after the character turns the option off.
                    The + sign is optional; for example, -r means the same
                    thing as -r+. You can list multiple options
                    individually (like this: -i -d -l), or you can combine
                    them (like this: -ild or -il, -d, and so on); it's all
                    the same to GREP.

                    Here are the GREP option characters and their meanings:


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Option Meaning
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  -c   Match Count only: Prints only a count of matching lines. For each file
       that contains at least one matching line, GREP prints the file name and
       a count of the number of matching lines. Matching lines are not
       printed. This option is off by default.

  -d   Search subdirectories: For each file specified on the command line,
       GREP searches for all files that match the file specification, both in
       the directory specified and in all subdirectories below the specified
       directory. If you give a file without a path, GREP assumes the files
       are in the current directory. This option is off by default.

  -i   Ignore case: GREP ignores upper/lowercase differences (case folding).
       When this option is on, GREP treats all letters a to z as identical to
       the corresponding letters A to Z in all situations. This option is on
       by default.



                                  - 12 -






  -l   List file names only: Prints only the name of each file containing a
       match. After GREP finds a match, it prints the file name and processing
       immediately moves on to the next file. This option is off by default.

  -n   Line Numbers: Each matching line that GREP prints is preceded by its
       line number. This option is off by default.

  -o   UNIX output format: Changes the output format of matching lines to
       support more easily the UNIX style of command-line piping. All lines of
       output are preceded by the name of the file that contained the matching
       line. This option is off by default.

  -r   Regular expression search: The text defined by searchstring is treated
       as a regular expression instead of as a literal string. This option is
       on by default. This option is on by default.

       A regular expression is one or more occurrences of one or more
       characters optionally enclosed in quotes. The following symbols are
       treated specially:
        ^  start of line       $  end of line
        .  any character       \  quote next character
        *  match zero or more  +  match one or more

        [aeiou0-9]             match a, e, i, o, u, and 0 thru 9
        [^aeiou0-9]            match anything but a, e, i, o, u, and 0 thru 9

  -u   Update options: GREP will combine the options given on the command line
       with its default options and write these to the GREP.COM file as the
       new defaults. (In other words, GREP is self-configuring.) This option
       allows you to tailor the default option settings to your own taste. If
       you want to see what the defaults are in a particular copy of GREP.COM,
       type

        GREP ?

       at the DOS prompt. Each option on the help screen will be followed by a
       + or a - depending on its default setting. This option is off by
       default.

  -v   Nonmatch: Prints only nonmatching lines. Only lines that do not contain
       the search string are considered to be nonmatching lines. This option
       is off by default.

  -w   Word search: Text found that matches the regular expression is
       considered a match only if the character immediately preceding and
       following cannot be part of a word. The default word character set
       includes A to Z, 0 to 9, and the underscore ( _ ). This option is off
       by default.

       An alternate form of this option lets you specify the set of legal word
       characters. Its form is -w[set], where set is any valid regular
       expression set definition.





                                  - 13 -






       If you define the set with alphabetic characters, it is automatically
       defined to contain both the uppercase and lowercase values for each
       letter in the set (regardless of how it is typed), even if the search
       is case-sensitive. If you use the -w option in combination with the -u
       option, the new set of legal characters is saved as the default set.

  -z   Verbose: GREP prints the file name of every file searched. Each
       matching line is preceded by its line number. A count of matching lines
       in each file is given, even if the count is zero. This option is off by
       default.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------  Remember that each of GREP's options is a switch: Its
          Order of  state reflects the way you last set it. At any given time,
        precedence  each option can only be on or off. Each occurrence of a
------------------  given option on the command line overrides its previous
                    definition. Given this command line,

                       grep -r -i - -d -i -r -  main( my*.c

                    GREP runs with the -d option on, the -i option on, and the
                    -r option off.

                    You can install your preferred default setting for each
                    option in GREP.COM with the -u option. For example, if you
                    want GREP to always do a verbose search (-z on), you can
                    install it with the following command:

                       grep -u -z


 The search string  ==========================================================

                    To use GREP well, you'll need to become proficient at
                    writing search strings. The value of searchstring defines
                    the pattern GREP searches for. A search string can be
                    either a regular expression or a literal string.

                    o In a regular expression, certain characters have special
                      meanings: They are operators that govern the search.

                    o In a literal string, there are no operators: Each
                      character is treated literally.

                    You can enclose the search string in quotation marks to
                    prevent spaces and tabs from being treated as delimiters.
                    The text matched by the search string cannot cross line
                    boundaries; that is, all the text necessary to match the
                    pattern must be on a single line.






                                  - 14 -






                    A regular expression is either a single character or a set
                    of characters enclosed in brackets. A concatenation of
                    regular expressions is a regular expression.


------------------  When you use the -r option (on by default), the search
      Operators in  string is treated as a regular expression (not a literal
           regular  expression). The following characters take on special
       expressions  meanings:
------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Option Meaning
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


  ^    A circumflex at the start of the expression matches the start of a
       line.

  $    A dollar sign at the end of the expression matches the end of a
       line.

  .    A period matches any character.

  *    An expression followed by an asterisk wildcard matches zero or more
       occurrences of that expression. For example, in to*, the * operates
       on the expression o; it matches t, to, too, etc. (t followed by zero
       or more os), but doesn't match ta.

  +    An expression followed by a plus sign matches one or more
       occurrences of that expression: to+ matches to, too, etc., but not
       t.

  [ ]  A string enclosed in brackets matches any character in that string,
       but no others. If the first character in the string is a circumflex
       (^), the expression matches any character except the characters in
       the string.

       For example, [xyz] matches x, y, or z, while [^xyz] matches a and b,
       but not x, y, or z. You can specify a range of characters with two
       characters separated by a hyphen (-). These can be combined to form
       expressions (like [a-bd-z?], which matches the ? character and any
       lowercase letter except c).

  \    The backslash escape character tells GREP to search for the literal
       character that follows it. For example, \. matches a period instead
       of "any character." The backslash can be used to quote itself; that
       is, you can use \\ to indicate a literal backslash character in a
       GREP expression.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

              Note  Four of the "special" characters ($, ., *, and +) don't
                    have any special meaning when used within a bracketed



                                  - 15 -






                    set. In addition, the character ^ is only treated
                    specially if it immediately follows the beginning of
                    the set definition (immediately after the [ delimiter).

                    Any ordinary character not mentioned in the preceding
                    list matches that character. For example, the greater
                    than sign, >, matches the greater than sign (>), #
                    matches #, and so on.


              File  =======================================================
    specifications
                    file(s) tells GREP which files (or groups of files) to
                    search. file(s) can be an explicit file name, or a
                    "generic" file name incorporating the DOS ? and *
                    wildcards. In addition, you can enter a path (drive and
                    directory information) as part of file(s). If you give
                    file(s) without a path, GREP searches the current
                    directory.

                    If you don't specify any files, input to GREP must come
                    from redirection (<) or a vertical bar (|).


Some GREP examples  =======================================================

                    The following examples show how to combine GREP's
                    features to do different kinds of searches. They assume
                    GREP's default settings are unchanged.


------------------  The search string here tells GREP to search for the
         Example 1  word main with no preceding lowercase letters ([^a-z]),
------------------  followed by zero or more occurrences of blank spaces
                    (\ *), then a left parenthesis.

                    Since spaces and tabs are normally considered to be
                    command-line delimiters, you must quote them if you
                    want to include them as part of a regular expression.
                    In this case, the space after main is quoted with the
                    backslash escape character. You could also accomplish
                    this by placing the space in double quotes.

                    Command line:
                                grep -r [^a-z]main\ *( *.c

                    Matches:    main(i:integer)
                                main(i,j:integer)
                                if (main  ()) halt;
                                if (MAIN  ()) halt;

                    Does not match:
                                mymain()




                                  - 16 -






                    Files searched:
                                *.C in current directory.


------------------  Because the backslash (\) and period (.) characters
         Example 2  usually have special meaning in path and file names,
------------------  you must place the backslash escape character immedi-
                    ately in front of them if you want to search for them.
                    The -i option is used here, so the search is not case
                    sensitive.

                    Command line:
                                grep -ri [a-c]:\\data\.fil *.c *.inc

                    Matches:    A:\data.fil
                                c:\Data.Fil
                                B:\DATA.FIL

                    Does not match:
                                d:\data.fil
                                a:data.fil

                    Files searched:
                                *.C and *.INC in current directory.


------------------  This format defines how to search for a given word.
         Example 3
------------------  Command line:
                                grep -ri [^a-z]word[^a-z] *.doc

                    Matches:    every new word must be on a new line.
                                MY WORD!
                                word--smallest unit of speech.
                                In the beginning there was the WORD, and
                                the WORD

                                grep "search string with spaces" *.doc *.c
                                a:\work\myfile.*

                    Matches:    This is a search string with spaces in it.

                    Does not match:
                                This search string has spaces in it.

                    Files searched:
                                *.DOC and *.C in the current directory, and
                                MYFILE.* in a directory called \WORK on
                                drive A.


------------------  This example searches for any one of the characters
         Example 6  " . : ? ' and , at the end of a line.
------------------
                    The double quote within the range is preceded by an
                    escape character so it is treated as a normal character
                    instead of as the ending quote for the string. Also,
                    the $ character appears outside of the quoted string.
                    This demonstrates how regular expressions can be
                    concatenated to form a longer expression.

                    Command line:
                                grep -rd "[ ,.:?'\"]"$ \*.doc

                    Matches:    He said hi to me.
                                Where are you going?
                                In anticipation of a unique situation,
                                Examples include the following:
                                "Many men smoke, but fu man chu."

                    Does not match:

===========================================================================
OBJXREF: The object module cross-reference utility
===========================================================================

                    OBJXREF examines a list of object files and library
                    files and produces reports on their contents. One type
                    of report lists definitions of public names and
                    references to them. The other type lists the segment
                    sizes defined by object modules.

                    There are two categories of public names: global
                    variables and function names. The TEST1.C and TEST2.C
                    files in the section "Sample OBJXREF reports" (page 25)
                    illustrate definitions of public names and external
                    references to them.

                    Object modules are object (.OBJ) files produced by BC,
                    BCC or TASM. A library (.LIB) file contains multiple
                    object modules. An object module generated by BC is
                    given the same name as the .C source file it was com-
                    piled from. This is also true for BCC, unless a
                    different output file name is specifically indicated
                    with the -o BCC command-line option.


  The OBJXREF com-  =======================================================
         mand line
                    The OBJXREF command line consists of the word OBJXREF
                    followed by a series of command-line options and a list
                    of object and library file names, separated by a space
                    or tab character. The syntax is as follows:

                      OBJXREF  options   filename  filename ...

                    The command-line options determine the kind of reports
                    that OBJXREF will generate and the amount of detail
                    that OBJXREF will provide. They are discussed in more
                    detail in the next section.

                    Each option begins with a forward slash (/) followed by
                    a one- or two-character option name.

                    Object files and library files may be specified either
                    on the command line or in a response file. On the com-
                    mand line, file names are separated by a space or a
                    tab. All object modules specified as .OBJ files are
                    included in reports. Like TLINK, however, OBJXREF
                    includes only those modules from .LIB files which
                    contain a public name referenced by an .OBJ file or by
                    a previously included module from a .LIB file.

                    As a general rule, you should list all the .OBJ and
                    .LIB files that are needed if the program is to link




                                  - 20 -






                    correctly, including the startup .OBJ file and one or
                    more C libraries.

                    File names may include a drive and directory path. The
                    DOS ? and * wildcard characters may be used to identify
                    more than one file. File names may refer to .OBJ object
                    files or to .LIB library files. (If you don't give a
                    file extension, the .OBJ extension is assumed.)

                    Options and file names may occur in any order in the
                    command line.

                    OBJXREF reports are written to the DOS standard output.
                    The default is the screen. The reports can be sent to a
                    printer (as with >LPT1:) or to a file (as with
                    >lstfile) with the DOS redirection character (>).

                    Entering OBJXREF with no file names or options produces
                    a summary of available options.


------------------  OBJXREF command-line options fall into two categories:
       The OBJXREF  control options and report options.
      command-line
           options
------------------  Control options
                    =======================================================

                    Control options modify the default behavior of OBJXREF
                    (the default is that none of these options are
                    enabled).


                    -------------------------------------------------------
                    Option Meaning
                    -------------------------------------------------------


                      /I   Ignore case differences in public names. Use
                           this option if you use TLINK without the /C
                           option (which makes case differences
                           significant).

                      /D   Look for .OBJ files in another directory. If you
                           want OBJXREF to look for .OBJ files in a
                           directory other than the current one, include
                           the directory name on the command line, prefixed
                           with /D:

                              OBJXREF /Ddir1 [; dir2 [; dir3]]

                           or

                              OBJXREF /Ddir1 [/Ddir2] [/Ddir3]



                                  - 21 -






                           OBJXREF will search each of the directories in
                           the specified order for all object and library
                           files.

        Important!         If you don't use a /D option, OBJXREF will
                           search only the current directory. If you do use
                           a /D option, however, the current directory will
                           not be searched unless it is included in the
                           directory list. For example, if you wanted
                           OBJXREF to search first the BORLAND directory
                           and then the current directory for files, you
                           would enter

                              OBJXREF /Dborland;.

                           The period denotes the current directory.


                      /F   Include full library. All object modules in
                           specified .LIB files are included even if they
                           do not contain public names that are referenced
                           by an object module being processed by OBJXREF.
                           This provides information on the entire contents
                           of a library file. (See example 4 in the section
                           "OBJXREF examples.")

                      /O   Allows you to specify an output file where
                           OBJXREF will send any reports generated. Its
                           syntax is as follows:

                              OBJXREF filename.obj /report option
                              /Ooutputfilename.ext

                           By default all output is sent to the screen.


                      /V   Verbose output. Lists names of files read and
                           displays totals of public names, modules,
                           segments, and classes.

                      /Z   Include zero-length segment definitions. Object
                           modules may define a segment without allocating
                           any space in it. Listing these zero length
                           segment definitions normally makes the module
                           size reports harder to use but it can be
                           valuable if you are trying to remove all defini-
                           tions of a segment.

                    Report options
                    =======================================================

                    Report options govern what sort of report is generated,
                    and the amount of detail that OBJXREF provides.

                    appears as _main).

                    You can limit the modules, segments, classes, or public
                    names that OBJXREF reports on by entering the
                    appropriate name on the command line prefixed with the
                    /N option. For example,

                       OBJXREF filelist /RM /NC0

                    tells OBJXREF to generate a report listing information
                    only for the module named C0.

    Response files  =======================================================

                    The command line is limited by DOS to a maximum of 128
                    characters. If your list of options and file names will
                    exceed this limit, you must place your file names in a
                    response file.

                    A response file is a text file that you make with a
                    text editor. Since you may already have prepared a list
                    of the files that make up your program for other
                    Borland C++ programs, OBJXREF recognizes several
                    response file types.

                    Response files are called from the command line using
                    one of the following options. The response file name
                    must follow the option without an intervening space
                    (so, for example, you would type /Lresp, not /L resp).

                    You can specify more than one response file on the com-
                    mand line; additional .OBJ and .LIB file names can
                    precede or follow them.


------------------  You can create a free-form response file with a text
Free-form response  editor. Just list the names of all .OBJ and .LIB files
             files  needed to make your .EXE file.
------------------
     Any file name  To use free-form files with OBJXREF, type in each
     listed in the  response file name on the command line, preceded by an
     response file  @, and separate it from other command-line entries with
 without an exten-  a space or tab:
sion is assumed to
  be an .OBJ file.     @filename  @filename ...


------------------  You can also use project files of the type generated by
     Project files  Borland C++'s integrated environment as response files.
------------------  In the command line, precede the project file name with
                    /P, like this:

                       /Pfilename

                    If the file name does not include an explicit exten-
                    sion, a .PRJ extension is assumed.

                    File names in the project file with a .C extension or
                    no extension are interpreted as specifying the
                    corresponding .OBJ file. You need not remove file
                    dependencies specified inside parentheses; they are
                    ignored by OBJXREF.

                    By itself, the list of files in a .PRJ file does not
                    specify a complete program--you must also specify a
                    startup file (C0x.OBJ) and one or more Borland C++
                    library files (MATHX.LIB, EMU.LIB, and CX.LIB, for
                    example). In addition, you may need to use the /D
                    option to specify the directory where OBJXREF should
                    look for your .OBJ files.


------------------  Files in TLINK response-file format can also be used by
   Linker response  OBJXREF. A linker response file called from the command
             files  line is preceded by /L, like so:
------------------
                       /Lfilename

                    To see how to use one of these files, refer to Example
                    2 in the section "Examples of how to use OBJXREF."


    Sample OBJXREF  =======================================================
           reports
                    Suppose you have two source files in your Borland C++
                    directory, and want to generate OBJXREF reports on the
                    object files compiled from them. The source files are
                    called TEST1.C and TEST2.C, and they look like this:

                     /* test1.c */
                     int i1;                       /* defines i1 */
                     extern int i2;                /* refers to i2 */
                     static int i3;                /* not a public name */
                     extern void look(void);       /* refers to look */

                     void main(void)               /* defines main */
                     {
                        int i4;                    /* not a public name */

                        look();                    /* refers to look */
                     }

                     /* test2.c */
                     #include <process.h>
                     extern int i1;                /* refers to i1 */
                     int i2;                       /* defines i2 */

                     void look(void)               /* defines look */
                     {
                        exit(i1);                  /* refers to exit... */
                     }                             /* and to i1 */

                    The object modules compiled from these source files are
                    TEST1.OBJ and TEST2.OBJ. You can tell OBJXREF what kind
                    of report to generate about these .OBJ files by
                    entering the file names on the command line, followed
                    by a /R and a second letter denoting report type.

              Note  The following examples show only useful parts of the
                    output.


------------------  A report by public names lists each of the public names
  Report by public  defined in the object modules being reported on,
       names (/RP)  followed by the name of the module in which it is

Examples of how to  =======================================================
       use OBJXREF
                    These examples assume that the application files are in
                    the current directory of the default drive and that the
                    Borland C++ startup files (C0x.OBJ) and the library
                    files are in the \BORLANDC\LIB directory.


------------------  C>OBJXREF \BORLANDC\lib\c0l test1 test2
         Example 1  \BORLANDC\lib\cl.lib
------------------
                    In this example, the TEST1.OBJ and TEST2.OBJ files and
                    the Borland C++ startup file \BORLANDC\LIB\C0L.OBJ and
                    the library file \BORLANDC\LIB\CL.LIB are specified.
                    Since no report type is specified, the resulting report
                    is the default report by reference, listing public
                    names and the modules that reference them.


------------------  C>OBJXREF /RV /Ltest1.arf
         Example 2
------------------  The TLINK response file TEST1.ARF contains the same
                    list of files as the command line in Example 1. The /RV
                    option is specified, so a report of every type will be
                    generated. TEST1.ARF contains

                     \BORLANDC\lib\c0l
                     test1 test2
                     test1.exe
                     test1.map
                     \BORLANDC\lib\cl


------------------  C>OBJXREF /RC B:c0s /Ptest1 @libs
         Example 3
------------------  The Borland C++ project file TEST1.PRJ specifies
                    TEST1.OBJ and TEST2.OBJ. The response file @libs
                    specifies libraries on a disk in the B drive. TEST1.PRJ
                    contains

                     test1
                     test2.c

                    The file LIBS contains

                       b:maths.lib b:emu.lib b:cs.lib

                    The startup and library files specified depend on the
                    memory model and floating point options used in compil-
                    ation. The /RC causes a report of class type to be
                    output.


------------------  C>OBJXREF /F /RV \BORLANDC\lib\cs.lib
         Example 4
------------------  This example reports on all the modules in the Borland
                    C++ library file CS.LIB; OBJXREF can produce useful

                    complete program. The /F causes all modules in CS.LIB

     OBJXREF error  =======================================================
      messages and
          warnings  OBJXREF generates two sorts of diagnostic messages:
                    error messages and warnings.

PRJCFG: Configuration file utility
===========================================================================


                    Creates the command-line configuration file from a
                    project file. You can also use it to create or update a
                    project file from a configuration file.

                    The command-line compiler looks for a default
                    configuration file named TURBOC.CFG, but you can
                    specify a different file with +pathname option. To use
                    PRJCFG to create a BCC configuration file from a
                    project file, you would type the following:

                     PRJCFG ProjFile.PRJ ConfigFile.CFG

                    To make a project file from a configuration file, type

                     PRJCFG ConfigFile.CFG ProjFile.PRJ



===========================================================================
PRJCNVT: Old projects for new
===========================================================================

                    This utility converts Turbo C 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 project
                    files to Borland C++ project files. The syntax for it
                    is

                       PRJCNVT infile[.PRJ] [outfile[.PRJ]]

                    or

                       PRJCNVT infile[.TC]  [outfile[.PRJ]]

                    If you specify a configuration file as input, it must
                    have a project file defined. The compiler options in
                    the .CFG file and the dependencies in the Turbo C 2.0
                    .PRJ file will be placed into the corresponding Borland
                    C++ .PRJ file.

                    If you specify a project file as input, only
                    dependencies information will be placed into the
                    Borland C++ .PRJ file. All compiler options will remain
                    default.



                                  - 31 -






                    If you don't provide an extension, .TC is assumed. If
                    PRJCNVT can't find a .TC file, it looks for a .PRJ
                    file.

                    The default name of the output file is the base name of
                    the input file with the extension .PRJ. For example,
                    STARS.TC will turn into STARS.PRJ. If the input and the
                    output name are the same, the old file will be renamed
                    to a .BAK file.



===========================================================================
PRJ2MAK: From project file to MAKE file
===========================================================================

                    This utility converts a .PRJ file to a .MAK file
                    (containing all relevant switches and settings) for use
                    with the MAKE utility. These files can be re-used
                    without accessing the IDE. The syntax for PRJ2MAK is

                       PRJ2MAK projectfile[.PRJ] [makefile[.MAK]
                    [config[.CFG]]]

                    The extension for the project file name is assumed to
                    be .PRJ unless you specify otherwise.

                    The default name for the new MAKE file is the base file
                    name of the .PRJ file with the extension .MAK. The
                    default name for the new .CFG file is the base file
                    name of the .MAK file with the extension .CFG.

                    To change the names of the makefile and configuration
                    files, just specify different names on the command
                    line.

                    Examples of valid execution:

                       PRJ2MAK MYPROJ.PRJ MAKEFILE.MAK TURBOC.CFG

                    This execution creates a makefile called MAKEFILE.MAK
                    with a configuration file called TURBOC.CFG.
                       PRJ2MAK MYPROJ.PRJ MAKEFILE.MAK

                    This execution creates a makefile called MAKEFILE.MAK
                    with a configuration file called MYPROJ.CFG.

                       PRJ2MAK MYPROJ

                    This execution creates a makefile called MYPROJ.MAK and
                    a configuration file called MYPROJ.CFG.

                    The makefile that PRJ2MAK creates will set up a
                    redirection file for the linker response file and for



                                  - 32 -






                    the .CFG file. They will be created when you run the
                    makefile that was generated. The linker response file
                    is a temporary file and will be deleted. The .CFG file
                    will be left as a file on disk.

                    PRJ2MAK places options that meet the following
                    requirements into the .CFG file: Those that are not
                    default to the Borland C++ command-line compiler and
                    have been selected in the project file.

                    PRJ2MAK will use the library search path as a command
                    link option to TLINK, so that TLINK can search that
                    path for the startup module and for libraries.

THELP: The Turbo Help utility
===========================================================================

                    THELP.COM is a RAM-resident (TSR) utility that accesses
                    Borland C++'s online Help information for you when you
                    aren't using the IDE (that is, if you are using an
                    editor other than the one in the IDE, or you are using
                    the command-line version of Borland C++, or if you are
                    using another product, such as Turbo Debugger). THELP
                    requires about 21K bytes of memory.


       Loading and  =======================================================
    invoking THELP
                    You need to first load THELP in order to use it from
                    within another program (or from the command line). Make
                    sure that TCHELP.TCH, the text file containing the
   Warning! If you  Borland C++ online help information, is in the current
 are going to have  directory. (If you want to keep TCHELP.TCH in another
 THELP resident in  directory, THELP has a special /F command-line option
memory at the same  that will enable THELP to find it; the INSTALL program
  time as SideKick  inserts the correct path information into THELP.)
   1.x or SideKick
   Plus, make sure  To load THELP, just type
    you load THELP
   before you load     THELP [options]
         SideKick.
                    at the DOS command line before you go into your
                    application. This needs to be done only once, when you
                    first boot up.

                    Once you are in the other application, you can activate
                    THELP at any time. Just position the cursor under the
                    item you want information on, then press the THELP hot
                    key. The default hot key is 5 on the numeric keypad
                    (scan code 4ch, shift state 00h).

         Help screen.

Esc      Ends Help session.

F1       Displays the Help Table of Contents screen.

Shift-F1 Displays the Help Index. You can search for a specific
         keyword incrementally. For example, you can find printf by
         typing p r i. With each letter you type, the list jumps to
         the keyword that starts with p, then to pr, then to pri, and
         so on.

Alt-F1   Pressing Alt-F1 repeatedly takes you in reverse order through
         the last 20 screens you have reviewed.

Alt-F    Selects a new Help file (if you have specified more than one
         help file in the THELP.CFG file or on the
         command-line).

Ctrl-P   Pastes the marked block or example text into your current
         application.

     THELP options  =======================================================

                    Here is a summary of the THELP command-line options. If
                    you use more than one option, you must separate them
                    with spaces.

                    The command-line options can be placed in a
                    configuration file (called THELP.CFG) for convenience.
                    THELP.CFG must be located in the same directory as
                    THELP.COM and each option in the configuration file
                    must be placed on its own line and begin in the
                    leftmost column.

TOUCH
===========================================================================

                    There are times when you want to force a particular
                    target file to be recompiled or rebuilt, even though no
                    changes have been made to its sources. One way to do
                    this is to use the TOUCH utility. TOUCH changes the
                    date and time of one or more files to the current date
                    and time, making it "newer" than the files that depend
                    on it.

                    You can force MAKE to rebuild a target file by touching
                    one of the files that target depends on. To touch a
                    file (or files), type

   You can use the    touch filename [filename ...]
   DOS wildcards *
 and ? with TOUCH.  at the DOS prompt. TOUCH will then update the file's
                    creation date(s). Once you do this, you can invoke MAKE
                    to rebuild the touched target file(s).

        Important!  Before you use the TOUCH utility, it's vitally
                    important to set your system's internal clock to the
                    proper date and time. If you're using an IBM PC, XT, or
                    compatible that doesn't have a battery-powered clock,
                    don't forget to set the time and date using the DOS
                    TIME and DATE commands. Failing to do this will keep
                    both TOUCH and MAKE from working properly.

TRANCOPY: A project transfer item utility
===========================================================================

                    TRANCOPY copies transfer items from one project to
                    another. The syntax is

                     TRANCOPY [-r] Source[.PRJ] Dest[.PRJ]

                    TRANCOPY merges the transfer items in Source with the
                    transfer in Dest; Dest gets the new transfer items.

                    If the -r option is used, the set of the transfer items
                    in Dest is replaced by the set of transfer items in
                    Source.



===========================================================================
TRIGRAPH: A character-conversion utility
===========================================================================

                    Trigraphs are three-character sequences that replace
                    certain characters used in the C language that are not
                    available on some keyboards. Translating trigraphs in
                    the compiler would slow compilation down considerably,
                    so Borland C++ provides a filter named TRIGRAPH.EXE to
                    handle trigraph sequences when you need to. The syntax
                    for invoking this program is as follows:

                       TRIGRAPH [-u] file(s) [file(s) ...]

                    The following table shows the trigraph sequences that
                    TRIGRAPH.EXE recognizes:


                    -------------------------------------------------------
                      Trigraph  Character
                    -------------------------------------------------------


                       ??=        #
                       ??(        [
                       ??/        \
                       ??)        ]
                       ??'        ^
                       ??<        {
                       ??!        |
                       ??>        }
                       ??-        ~

                    -------------------------------------------------------





                                  - 39 -






                    TRIGRAPH.EXE works in two directions: It can convert
                    all trigraphs to their single-character representation,
                    and it can convert single characters to their trigraph
                    representation. Ordinarily, TRIGRAPH.EXE converts
                    trigraphs to single characters. You can specify the
                    inverse conversion with the -u (UNDO) command-line
                    option, which must come before any file names on the
                    command line.

                    TRIGRAPH.EXE takes any number of file specifiers,
                    including wildcards, on the command line. For each file
                    specified, it creates a backup copy of the file with
                    the original file name and an extension of .BAK, and
                    creates a new file with the original file name and the
                    appropriate conversions performed. For example,

                       trigraph test.c test1.c

                    removes all trigraphs from the two files TEST.C and
                    TEST1.C, creating backup files TEST.BAK and TEST1.BAK.

                    As another example, the following command inserts
                    trigraphs into all the files with the extension .C, and
                    makes backup copies of all those files, giving them the
                    extension .BAK.

                       trigraph -u *.c

Transfer macros
===========================================================================

                    The IDE recognizes certain strings of characters called
                    transfer macros in the parameter string of the
                    Modify/New Transfer Item dialog box. There are three
                    kinds of macros: state, file name, and instruction.


      The transfer  State macros

                    File name macros
                    =======================================================

                    File name macros are actually functions that take file
                    names as arguments and return various parts of the file
                    name. They allow you to build up new file name
                    specifications from existing file names. For example,
                    you can pass TDUMP a macro like this:

                       $DIR($EXENAME)$NAME($EDNAME).OBJ

                    This macro gives you the output directory path, the
                    file name only in the active Edit window, and an
                    explicit extension. If your current directory is
                    C:\WORK, your output directory is TEST, and the active
                    editor contains MYPROG.C, then TDUMP receives the
                    parameter

                       C:\WORK\TEST\MYPROG.OBJ

                    The file name macros are

                    $DIR                          $EXT()
                    $DRIVE()                      $NAME()
                    $EDNAME                       $OUTNAME
                    $EXENAME


                    Instruction macros
                    =======================================================

                    Instruction macros tell the IDE to perform some action
                    or make some setting. The instruction macros are

                    $CAP EDIT                     $PROMPT
                    $CAP MSG(filter)              $RC
                    $DEP()                        $SAVE ALL
                    $IMPLIB                       $SAVE CUR
                    $MEM(kb to reserve)           $SAVE PROMPT
                    $NOSWAP                       $TASM

                    $CAP EDIT: This macro tells the IDE to redirect program
                    output into a standard file. After the transfer program
                    is completed, a new editor window is created, and the
                    captured output is displayed. The captured output
                    resides in a special Edit window titled Transfer
                    Output.

                    For $CAP EDIT to work correctly, the transfer program
                    must write to DOS standard output.

                    $CONFIG: Complete file name of the current
                    configuration file. This is a null string if no
                    configuration file is defined. This macro is intended
                    for use by programs that access or modify the
                    configuration file. Besides providing the name of the
                    file, this macro causes the current configuration to be
                    saved (if modified) and reloaded when control returns
                    to the IDE.

                    MYAPP1.RES for your application MYAPP1.EXE consists of
                    the following files:

                    o MYAPP1.RC (the resource source file)
                    o MYAPP1.H (the header file for MYAPP1.EXE)
                    o MYAPP1.ICO (the icon for MYAPP1.EXE, included in
                      MYAPP1.RC)
                    o MYAPP1.BMP (the bitmap used with MYAPP1.EXE, included
                      in MYAPP1.RC)

                    To ensure that MYAPP1.RES gets recompiled any time you
                    update one of the components, you'd add the following
                    dependencies to the Options field in the Project|Local
                    Options dialog box for MYAPP1.RC:

                       $DEP(MYAPP1.H MYAPP1.ICO MYAPP1.BMP)

                    When you choose Compile|Make, the project manager scans
                    for the $DEP macro and verifies that all explicit
                    dependencies given are older than the resulting
                    MYAPP1.RES file. If one or more aren't, the project
                    manager recompiles MYAPP1.RC.

                    You can give explicit dependencies to any makeable
                    project item. Just place the files you want the source
                    to be dependent on in parentheses, separated by blanks,
                    commas, or semicolons. If autodependency checking is
                    on, explicit dependencies are checked after any
                    autodependencies.

                    $DIR(): Directory of the file argument, full path.

                    $DRIVE(): Drive of the file argument, in the form D:.

                    $EDNAME: Complete file name of file in active editor.
                    This is a null string if the active window is not an
                    editor.

                    $ERRCOL: Column number of current error in file
                    $ERRNAME. If there are no messages, then string is
                    expanded to null string.

                    $ERRLINE: Line number of current error in file
                    $ERRNAME. If there are no messages, then string is
                    expanded to null string.

                    $ERRNAME: Complete file name of file referred to by the
                    selected messages in the Message window. This is a null
                    string if there are no messages or the currently
                    selected message does not refer to a file.

                    $EXENAME: Program's file name (including output path),
                    based on the project name or, if there is no project
                    defined, then the name of the .EXE that would be
                    produced from the active editor window. If the Windows
                    DLL Linker option is selected, the file's extension
                    will be .DLL.

                    $EXT(): Extension of the file argument; this includes
                    the dot (for example, .CPP).

                    $IMPLIB: Executes IMPLIB.This macro expands to





                                  - 43 -






                     $NOSWAP $CAP MSG(IMPL2MSG)
                     $DRIVE($EXENAME)$DIR($EXENAME)$NAME($EXENAME).LIB
                     $EXENAME|def_name

                    If the Use DLL File Exports radio button is pushed
                    (Options|MAKE|Generate Import Library), $EXENAME is
                    part of the expansion. If the Use DEF file Exports
                    radio button is pushed, the name of the DEF file in the
                    project (represented by def_name) is used.

                    $INC: Pulls in the contents of the Options|Directories|
                    Include Directories type-in box.

                    $LIB: Pulls in the contents of the Options|Directories|
                    Library Directories type-in box.

                    $LINE: Line number of current editor. If the active
                    window is not an editor, then the string is set to 0.

                    $MEM(Kb to reserve): This macro tells the IDE how much
                    memory to try to give the transfer program. The IDE
                    gives up as much memory as possible, to either the
                    amount specified or the maximum available, whichever is
                    smaller. You'll get an error if no memory is specified.

                    $NAME(): Name part of the file argument; does not
                    include the dot.

                    $NOSWAP: This macro tells the IDE not to swap to the
                    User Screen when running the program. It pops up a box
                    that indicates which transfer program is running. Use
                    this macro in conjunction with $CAP.

                    $OUTNAME: This macro expands to the path and file name
                    that appear in the Project|Local Options Output Path
                    type-in box (in the active edit window). For example,
                    if the project contains STARS.C, the default Output
                    Path type-in is STARS.OBJ. So if STARS.C is in the
                    active edit window, $OUTNAME expands to STARS.OBJ. If
                    you've edited the type-in box so it says ..\MOON.XYZ,
                    $OUTNAME will expand to ..\MOON.XYZ. This macro is
                    useful when you are specifying modules for your user-
                    defined translators. For example, you could define a
                    TLIB translator and set the command line to

                    TLIB MYLIB +$OUTNAME

                    which adds the object module of the file in the active
                    edit window to the library MYLIB.

                    $PRJNAME: The current project file. Null string if no
                    project is defined.

                    $PROMPT: This macro tells the IDE to display the
                    expanded parameter string before calling the transfer
                    program. The command line that will be passed is
                    displayed in a dialog box. This allows you to change or
                    add to the string before it is passed.The position of
                    $PROMPT command in the command line determines what is
                    shown in the dialog prompt box. You can place constant
                    parameters in the command line by placing them before
                    $PROMPT. For example, the /c in

                       /c $PROMPT dir

                    is constant and doesn't show in the dialog box, but dir
                    can be edited before the command is run.

                    $RC: This macro is predefined for use with the Resource
                    Compiler. Since the Resource Compiler can be invoked
                    for two separate reasons, $RC is expanded differently
                    depending on whether you are compiling a .RC file into
                    a .RES file or binding the .RES file to an executable
                    file.

                    In any case, in order to change the behavior of the
                    Resource Compiler

                    o when compiling an .RC file, change the command line
                      for the .RC file in the Command Line Options input
                      box in the Override Options dialog box (Project|Local
                      Options)

                    o when binding a .RES file to an .EXE or a DLL, change
                      the options in the Command Line input box in the
                      Modify/New Transfer Items dialog box for the Resource
                      Compiler (Options|Transfer|Edit button)

                    If you are compiling a .RC file into a .RES file, $RC
                    is expanded like this:

                       $SAVE CUR $NOSWAP $CAP MSG(RC2MSG) -R -I$INC -FO
                    $OUTNAME $EDNAME

                    If you are binding a .RES to an .EXE file, $RC is
                    expanded like this:

                       $NOSWAP $CAP MSG(RC2MSG) res_name $EXENAME

                    The variable res_name is defined as one of the
                    following, in this order:

                    1. If there is a file in the project with a .RES
                       extension, res_name will be that file.






                                  - 45 -






                    2. If there is no file with a .RES extension, and there
                       is a file with a .RC extension, res_name is the name
                       given by $OUTNAME for the .RC file.

                    3. If neither of the above apply (implying there are no
                       resources), res_name is blank.

                    $SAVE ALL: This macro tells the IDE to save all
                    modified files in all Edit windows that have been
                    modified, without prompting.

                    $SAVE CUR: This macro tells the IDE to save the file in
                    the current editor if it has been modified. This
                    ensures that the invoked program will use the latest
                    version of the source file.

                    $SAVE PROMPT: This macro tells the IDE to prompt when
                    there are unsaved files in editor windows. You will be
                    asked if you want to save any unsaved files.

                    $TASM: This macro is predefined for use with Turbo
                    Assembler. It uses the TASM2MSG filter to trap TASM
                    messages. $TASM is essentially shorthand for this:

                     $NOSWAP $SAVE CUR $CAP MSG(TASM2MSG) $EDNAME,$OUTNAME

                    $WRITEMSG(filename): This macro copies the contents of
                    the Message window to the specified ASCII file. The
                    translator can parse the file and act on the messages
                    so desired. For example, $WRITEMSG(C:\MESSAGES.TXT)
                    writes to the file MESSAGES.TXT on your root directory.


       Running DOS  =======================================================
          commands
                    If you want to run DOS commands from within the
                    integrated environment, you can set up a simple
                    transfer macro that will let you do so. Just add this
                    transfer item:

                       command /c $MEM(128) $PROMPT

                    When you invoke this transfer item, a dialog box
                    appears and prompts you for DOS input. Since the
                    $PROMPT command appears later in the string, the text
                    command /c won't show up in the dialog's input box.
                    This lets you just type dir, chkdsk, del *.*, or
                    whatever DOS command you want to run.

   Transfer memory  =======================================================
          settings
                    Different programs have different memory needs. For
                    example, GREP can run in very little memory, where many
                    popular editors require 200-300K to work well.

                    If you use the $MEM() macro, you can specify (on a
                    program-by-program basis) how much memory the IDE
                    should give to the transfer programs. The less memory
                    you devote to a transfer program, the quicker the
                    transfer to and from the program occurs.

                    There may be some cases where the IDE cannot give up as
                    much memory as you requested. When this happens, the
                    IDE gives up as much as it can. There are certain
                    states in the IDE that require more memory than others;
                    for example, while debugging a program, the IDE will
                    tie up more resources than when not debugging. Use
                    Program Reset (Ctrl-F2) to free up debugging memory.

                    In those cases where you want the IDE to give up all
                    its memory, give it a large number, like 640K. How much
                    memory is actually given up is dependent on how much
                    you have when you start Borland C++.



===========================================================================
Turbo Editor macros
===========================================================================

                    TEMC.EXE is an editor macro compiler for the IDE. It
                    processes a script file that defines editor macros and
                    key bindings, and produces a configuration file that is
                    read by the IDE to define the effects of keyboard
                    commands in the editor.

                    The file DEFAULTS.TEM contains the default macro
                    definitions and key bindings built into the IDE editor.
                    It serves as an example script, as well as a base from
                    which to customize the editor.



===========================================================================
TEMC command line
===========================================================================

                    TEMC is invoked from the DOS command line. Type

                     temc [-c] [-u] <script file> <config file>






                                  - 47 -






                    The script file extension is .TEM if not specified
                    otherwise. The configuration file extensions is assumed
                    to be .TC.

                    The configuration file need not exist. If it does not
                    exist, it is created. The optional -c switch can also
                    be specified as /c, and can appear in any argument
                    position on the command line. If you use this option,
                    any existing command table in your configuration file
                    is thrown away before TEMC processes the script file.
                    When -c is not used, the key bindings in the script
                    file are merged with those already defined in the
                    configuration file.

                    TEMC by default modifies the commands used by the IDE
                    when the Alternate command set is specified in Options|
                    Environment|Preferences. The optional -u switch, which
                    can also be specified as /u, causes TEMC to modify the
                    CUA command set instead.

                    You can use DEFAULTS.TEM to re-create exactly the
                    default settings of the Alternate command set.  This
                    file is included as both a sample script file and as
                    the default command table. You can copy it and modify
                    it for your own use. A file named CMACROS.TEM is
                    provided with Borland C++; this file contains many
                    useful enhancements to the IDE for C and C++
                    programming that you may wish to install.



===========================================================================
Syntax
===========================================================================

                    The syntax to define a macro is

                     MACRO <macroname>
                       <command1>;
                       [ <command2>; ... ]
                     END;

                    <macroname> can consist of anything that is a legal C
                    symbol, and <command> can be either the name of another
                    predefined macro or a predefined TEMC editor command. A
                    list of editor commands and what they do follows.

                    When you define your macro, the following points are
                    valid:

                    1. A statement defines either a named macro or a key
                       binding.

                    2. Spaces and new lines are optional.



                                  - 48 -






                    3. Comments are in C-style /* ... */ pairs.

                    4. Unlike C, TEMC's language is case insensitive.

                    5. Some of the predefined editor commands have a syntax
                       that looks like a C function call with one argument.
                       For example,
                        
                        SetMark(5);
                        
                       Depending on the command, the argumment is either a
                       decimal integer constant, a character constant, or a
                       string literal. All are specified using C syntax.

                    Here's an example of a macro definition from
                    DEFAULTS.TEM:

                     MACRO MacScrollUp
                       ScrollScreenUp; FixCursorPos;
                     END;

                    The syntax to define a key binding is

                     <key-sequence>: <command>;

                    or

                     <key-sequence>: BEGIN <command1>; [ <command2>; ... ]
                     END;

                    The <key-sequence> is either a key (a character
                    optionally preceded by Ctrl or Alt), or a series of
                    keys separated by a plus sign (+). Note that the
                    specification of the key characters themselves is case
                    sensitive. For example, Ctrl-k+B is different than
                    Ctrl-k+b, even though the latter is the same as CTRL-
                    K+b.

                    Whitespace is allowed between the key-sequence and the
                    colon, and each <command> can be either the name of a
                    previously defined macro, or one of the predefined
                    editor commands listed in Table 1.1.

Key codes
===========================================================================

                    The IDE editor makes use of an extended character set
                    that includes key combinations not normally available
                    to DOS programs. Key codes can be specified in a script
                    through any combination of the symbols "Ctrl-",
                    "Shift-" "Alt-" and a character.

                    Some keys cannot be entered directly into a TEMC
                    script. Those keys can be referred to by their names,
                    as described in the following table.

                    Any key in a sequence--except the first key--can be
                    preceded by one of the characters ^ or @. The caret (^)
                    indicates that any combination of case and "Ctrl" can
                    be used to type the key; that is, lowercase, uppercase,
                    or control characters. The @ sign is used to indicate
                    that case is insignificant for the following character,
                    although "Ctrl" is not accepted. For example,

                    o Ctrl-k+b specifies a Ctrl-K followed by a lowercase
                      b.

                    o Ctrl-k+^b specifies a Ctrl-K followed by any of b, B,
                      or Ctrl-B.

                    o Ctrl-k+@B specifies Ctrl-K followed by either b or B.


        Named keys  =======================================================

                    Key are specified as letters, numbers, or characters,
                    optionally preceded by one or more of Ctrl-, Alt- or
                    Shift-. The following names specify keys that cannot be
                    typed as themselves in the TEMC syntax.

Predefined editor commands
===========================================================================

                    TEMC lets you use built-in editor commands and user-
                    defined macros as commands within macros
                    interchangeably, as long as you don't create any loops
                    by having two macros calling each other, even via
                    intermediate macros. Note that some commands cause an
                    escape from the editor to the surrounding IDE, for
                    example, by bringing up a dialog box. Your macro will
                    "pause" until control returns to the editor.

                    A list of all predefined TEMC editor commands is shown
                    next. Commands that cause an escape from the editor
                    follow.

                                                visible. If any adjustment
                                                is necessary, adjust the
                                                display so the cursor is
                                                close to being centered in

                                                "string" in the buffer at
                                                the current cursor
                                                location. Use the syntax
                                                InsertText(string) to call
                                                this command.

                    LeftOfLine                  Moves cursor to beginning
                                                of the current line.

                                                the current cursor
                                                location, without doing any
                                                special processing for
                                                newline, tab characters,
                                                etc. Use the syntax
                                                LiteralChar(c), where c is
                                                a character or integer
                                                value.

                    MarkBufModified             Sets a flag indicating that
                                                the contents of the buffer
                                                are different than what is
                                                in the corresponding disk
                                                file.

                    MarkBufUnModified           Clears a flag, thus
                                                indicating that the
                                                contents of the buffer can
                                                be assumed to be identical
                                                to what is in the disk
                                                file.

                    MatchPairBackward           Same as MatchPairForward
                                                except if the cursor is on
                                                a ' or ", searches backward
                                                for the matching character.

                    MatchPairForward            If the cursor is on one of
                                                the characters (, ), {, },
                                                [, ], or on the first
                                                character of one of the
                                                pairs /* or */, searches in
                                                the appropriate direction
                                                for the closest instance of
                                                the matching delimiter. If
                                                the cursor is on the
                                                character ' or ", searches
                                                forward for the matching
                                                character. If a match is
                                                found, places the cursor
                                                there.
